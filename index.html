This document specifies the Web Payments messages that are used to
initiate and acknowledge a payment request via the HTTP protocol. The messages
are typically passed between the software ecosystem that inititates, executes,
and finalizes Web Payments.

  <h1>Introduction</h1>

  <p>
When requesting and fulfilling a payment via HTTP on the Web, a number of
messages need to be passed between various parties to execute the movement of
funds. This specification details those HTTP messages and provides instructions
on how to interpret those messages in a variety of operating environments.
  </p>

  <section class="informative">
    <h2>How to Read this Document</h2>

    <p>This document is detailed specification for a set of HTTP messages
    related to initiating, executing, and finalizing payments on the Web.
    The document is primarily intended for the following audiences:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Software developers who want to understand the design decisions and
        structure of the HTTP messages.</li>
      <li>Software developers who want to implement Web Payments systems
        using the HTTP protocol.</li>
    </ul>

    <section>
      <h3>Data Model Approach</h3>

      <p>
When designing software systems, the data model used to express
the components of the system is important. Data models tend to vary in their
formalism. Some data models are more abstract where data values are not typed
and only vaguely defined as to what their allowable values may be.
Other data models are more concrete, with strongly defined value types and
ranges.
      </p>

      <p>
The data model used to document the messages in this specification tends
toward being more abstract. This is done to aid readability and ensure that
the data model can be applied in a variety of programming environments. There
is also a mechanism that we use in this specification that enables more
formalism when it comes to data types and ranges. This is done to ensure that
programmers can re-use specific data validation tooling if it is available to
them.
      </p>

      <p>
In an attempt to make the description of this approach easier to understand,
note the following simple example of a <code>HelloWorld</code>
message definition:
      </p>

    <h5 style="font-size: 1.2em">HelloWorld</h5>

      <p>
A message that is used to greet the world.
      </p>

          <dl>
            <dt><code>title</code></dt>
            <dd>
A short human-readable title for the message.
            </dd>
            <dt><code>message</code></dt>
            <dd>
The message text itself.
            </dd>
          </dl>

      <p>
Note that there are no formal data value constraints expressed in the message
definition in the data model. Even though the data model is fairly abstract,
constraints can still be placed on the values in each concrete syntax (e.g.,
JSON Schema [[JSON-SCHEMA-CORE]] [[JSON-SCHEMA-VALIDATION]]
in most JSON environments). These constraints can be found in the
sections titled
<a href="#expressing-messages-as-webidl">Expressing Messages as WebIDL</a>,
<a href="#expressing-messages-as-json">Expressing Messages as JSON</a>, and
<a href="#expressing-messages-as-json-ld">Expressing Messages as JSON-LD</a>.
      </p>

      <p class="issue" data-number="2" title="Should concrete expressions be normative?">
Whether or not the "Expressing Messages as..." sections should be normative,
or in an appendix is currently under debate.
      </p>

      <p>
For example, if a developer wanted to express the <code>HelloWorld</code>
message definition above in JSON, the following JSON Schema could be used to
validate such a message:
      </p>

      <pre class="highlight">
{
  "title": "HelloWorld Message JSON Schema",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "title": {
      "type": "string"
    },
    "message": {
      "type": "string"
    }
  },
  "required": ["title", "message"]
}

  <h2>HTTP messages</h2>

  <p class="issue" data-number="1" title="How should we test Web Payments messages?">
It has been suggested that for the purposes of testing, we should have at least
one normative representation of messages in JSON Schema format.
  </p>

    <section>
      <h3><dfn>PaymentRequest</dfn></h3>

      <p>
A <a><code>PaymentRequest</code></a> expresses a payment that is requested
by a <a>payee</a>.
      </p>


  <figure>
    <img alt="payment request contents" style="margin: auto; display: block; width: 50%;" src="payment-request.svg">

- The contents of a PaymentRequest message.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

      <dl>
        <dt><code>type</code></dt>
        <dd>
A set of one or more type identifiers associated with the object, typically
set to <code>"PaymentRequest"</code>.

<div class="issue" data-number="6" title="What is the range for 'type' in PaymentRequest?">
The set of available types MAY be extended in the future to, for example,
add things like <code>"SubscriptionRequest"</code> to identify payment
requests that may have some recurring quality to them.
</div>
        </dd>
        <dt><code>description</code></dt>
        <dd>
A human-readable description of the reason the payment request was initiated.
This text MAY be displayed to the <a>payer</a> in a payment interface.
For example, <code>"Payment for widgets from Acme Anvil Emporium"</code>.
        </dd>
        <dt><code>paymentTerms</code></dt>
        <dd>
One or more <a>PaymentTerms</a> that the <a>payee</a> will
accept as payment.
        </dd>
        <dt><code>paymentDetails</code></dt>
        <dd>
An optional set of information concerning the details of why the payment
was requested, such as a list of items being purchased.
        </dd>
        <dt><code>paymentOptions</code></dt>
        <dd>
An optional set of requests that are intended for the payment mediator or the
payment application. For example, a <a>payee</a> may request that a payment
mediator return the shipping address and the email address selected by
the <a>payer</a>.
        </dd>
      </dl>

<p class="issue" data-number="7" title="Should HTTP messages contain paymentDetails and paymentOptions?">
The format for the <code>paymentDetails</code> and <code>paymentOptions</code>
objects are still being actively discussed. They are expected to take the
form of the
<a href="https://w3c.github.io/browser-payment-api/#paymentdetails-dictionary">PaymentDetails</a>
and the
<a href="https://w3c.github.io/browser-payment-api/#paymentoptions-dictionary">PaymentOptions</a>
objects in the
<a href="https://w3c.github.io/browser-payment-api/">Web Payments Browser API</a>.

  }
};
      </pre>

      <p class="issue" data-number="3" title="Validation of values that may contain more than one item">
Whether or not values that may contain one or more items, such as
<code>paymentTerms</code> above should throw an error during validation
if they are not an array is under discussion. That is, should we say that
values that could contain more than one item MUST always be wrapped in an array?
      </p>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h3><dfn>PaymentResponse</dfn></h3>

      <p>
A <a><code>PaymentResponse</code></a> expresses the result of processing
a payment request.
      </p>

  <figure>
    <img alt="payment response contents" style="margin: auto; display: block; width: 50%;" src="payment-response.svg">

    </figcaption>
  </figure>

      <dl>
        <dt><code>type</code></dt>
        <dd>
An type identifier associated with the object, typically set to
<code>"PaymentResponse"</code>.

<div class="issue" data-number="8" title="What is the value range for 'type' property in PaymentResponse?">
The set of available types MAY be extended in the future to add things
like <code>Receipt</code> to identify acknowledgements that contain
receipt information.
</div>
        </dd>
        <dt><code>description</code></dt>
        <dd>
Human readable text that will be used to identify what the payment was for.
This text MAY be displayed to the <a>payer</a>. For example,
<code>"Payment to ExampleMerch for widgets"</code>.
        </dd>
        <dt><code>paymentTerms</code></dt>
        <dd>
Information such as the payment method used and the payment amount. Payment
method specific information, such as the status of the payment, MAY also be
included. The presence and meaning of this extra information is dependent on
the payment method. The payment information MAY be used by the <a>payee</a> or
their associated <a>payment service provider</a> to, for example, finalize a
payment or display information to the <a>payer</a>.
        </dd>
        <dt><code>paymentOptions</code></dt>
        <dd>
Any payment options that were requested by the payee, such as email address,
phone number, or billing address.

  <h2>Supporting Datatypes</h2>

    <section>
      <h3><dfn>FinancialAmount</dfn></h3>
      <p>
A <a><code>FinancialAmount</code></a> is used to express a scalar financial
value.
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt><code><dfn>currency</dfn></code></dt>
        <dd>
<code>currency</code> is a string containing a three-character alphaneumeric
code for the currency as defined by [[!ISO4217]] or a URL for a currency
identifier. For example, <code>"USD"</code> for US Dollars or
<code>"https://example.com/currencies/experimental-XYZ"</code> for a new
experimental currency.
        </dd>
        <dt><code><dfn>amount</dfn></code></dt>
        <dd>
A string containing the decimal monetary value. The string MUST use a single
U+002E FULL STOP character as the decimal separator. All other characters
must be characters in the range U+0030 DIGIT ZERO (0) to U+0039 DIGIT NINE (9).
<div class="note">
The string should match the regular expression
<code>^[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?$</code>.
</div>
        </dd>

    <h2>Message Extensibility</h2>

    <p class="issue" data-number="9" title="How is message extensibility achieved?">
One proposal for providing message extensibility is to allow messages to
be interpreted as JSON-LD with a specific context, such as
<code>https://example.org/contexts/web-payments/v1</code>. Doing this would
not only solve message versioning, but it would also enable
decentralized extensibility for all payment messages while ensuring that
there are no clashes in terminology between industry verticals.
